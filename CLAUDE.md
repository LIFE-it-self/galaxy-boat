# Galaxy Boat — CLAUDE.md

## What this is
A browser-based pixel-art mini-RPG built in Phaser 3. Player is Captain Chowder John. Goal: get Cody off the Galaxy Boat by completing minigames and a 4-step ritual (pipe → dinner → shower → nap) in the correct order. Failure or wrong order = Cody becomes a hurricane and sinks Florida. Fail cutscene shows Cody on a coral throne as Aquaman.

This is an inside joke for the developer's friend group. It is not a commercial product. Tone is absurd, nothing takes itself seriously. 15–30 minute playthrough.

## Tech stack (decided, do not change)
- Phaser 3.80.x
- Vite (bundler + dev server)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no TypeScript)
- No Tiled (rooms are JS arrays in src/data/rooms.js)
- No Grid Engine plugin (custom 4-direction movement in src/objects/Player.js)
- No localStorage (state lives in game.registry)
- Free (CC0 / CC-BY) assets only

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — start dev server, opens at http://localhost:5173
- `npm run build` — production build to dist/
- `npm run preview` — preview production build locally
- `npm run deploy` — push dist/ to gh-pages branch (deploys to GitHub Pages)

## Architecture
- All minigames extend `src/scenes/minigames/BaseMinigame.js`
- Add new minigames as one new scene file plus one entry in `src/data/levels.js`
- Game state lives on Phaser's `game.registry` via `src/systems/GameStateManager.js`
- Cross-scene events go through `src/systems/EventBus.js`
- Ritual order is enforced by `src/systems/SequenceGuard.js`
- HUD is a parallel scene (`HUDScene`), not embedded in gameplay scenes
- Dialog is a parallel scene (`DialogScene`), not modal blocking

## Key patterns
- Minigame lifecycle: TITLE_CARD → INSTRUCTION → PLAY → EVALUATE → WIN/LOSE (handled by BaseMinigame)
- Scene transitions: `this.scene.start('SceneKey', { data })`
- Cross-scene data: `this.registry.get('key')` / `this.registry.set('key', value)`
- Ritual steps: scenes that extend BaseMinigame and set `isRitual: true` in their level config

## Failure threshold
- 5 failed minigames = hurricane fail cutscene
- Wrong-order ritual attempt = immediate hurricane fail cutscene

## Resolution
- Internal: 256×224 (SNES standard)
- pixelArt: true, roundPixels: true
- Tile size: 16×16
- Character sprites: 16×16 (or 16×24 for taller)

## Art strategy
- Sessions 1–7: placeholder rectangles, circles, Phaser graphics primitives only
- Session 8: real sprites are dropped in to replace placeholders
- One Cody variant for v1 (CodySelectScene exists as a stub but is disabled)

## Required reading at the start of every session
- This file (CLAUDE.md)
- docs/GAME-DESIGN.md (game design source of truth)
- docs/PHASE_LOG.md (what's been built so far, in what order)

## What NOT to do
- Do NOT use TypeScript
- Do NOT add npm dependencies unless explicitly approved
- Do NOT modify src/scenes/minigames/BaseMinigame.js from a minigame file
- Do NOT use localStorage (use game.registry)
- Do NOT build a character creator (one Cody for v1)
- Do NOT use copyrighted music or art
- Do NOT introduce Tiled, Grid Engine, or any plugin/tool not already in package.json
- Do NOT skip git hooks with --no-verify
- Do NOT add type hints, docstrings, or refactors to code that wasn't part of the current session's goal
- Do NOT mark a task complete if anything is broken — keep it in_progress and ask the user

## Current phase
Session 1 complete. Phaser 3 + Vite project scaffolded. Boot and MainMenu scenes work. Deployed to https://LIFE-it-self.github.io/galaxy-boat/. Next: Session 2 — overworld with 4 boat rooms and player movement.

## Sprite/asset placeholder conventions (Sessions 1–7)
- Player (Captain) = blue 16×16 rectangle
- Cody = green 16×16 rectangle
- Werewolf Cody = gray 16×16 rectangle with red eye dots
- Aquaman Cody = teal 16×16 rectangle with yellow trident dot
- Mermaids = pink 16×16 rectangles
- K-fish (gold) = yellow K shape from two rectangles
- K-fish (red) = red K shape from two rectangles
- Pipe = brown 8×4 rectangle
- Coke can = red 8×12 rectangle
- Door / interact zone = invisible Phaser zone with a small visible icon overlay (yellow ! mark)
